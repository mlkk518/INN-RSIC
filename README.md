## Abstract
> Despite the impressive performance of existing image compression algorithms,
they struggle to balance perceptual quality and high image fidelity. To address this issue,
we propose a novel invertible neural network-based remote sensing image compression
(INN-RSIC) method. Our approach captures the compression distortion from an existing
image compression algorithm and encodes it as Gaussian-distributed latent variables
using an INN, ensuring that the distortion in the decoded image remains independent
of the ground truth. By using the inverse mapping of the INN, we input the decoded
image with randomly resampled Gaussian variables, generating enhanced images with
improved perceptual quality. We incorporate channel expansion, Haar transformation, and
invertible blocks into the INN to accurately represent compression distortion. Additionally,
a quantization module (QM) is introduced to mitigate format conversion impact, enhancing
generalization and perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show that INN-RSIC achieves
superior perceptual quality and fidelity compared to existing algorithms. As a lightweight
plug-and-play (PnP) method, the proposed INN-based enhancer can be easily integrated
into existing high-fidelity compression algorithms, enabling flexible and simultaneous
decoding of images with enhanced perceptual quality.

- **Step I.**  Change the roots of ./ELIC/scripts/test.sh to your data and Use the pretrained models of [ELIC] to generate the initial decoded images.

- **Step II.**  Refer to option/test_IRN_compress_S1_0.0004.yml to set the data roots and pretrained models of [INN-RSIC] (./weights/), and run sh ./scripts/tetest_comS1.sh LAMBDA. Here lambda belongs to [0.0004, 0.0008, 0.0016, 0.0032,  0.045] 

```

sh ./ELIC/scripts/test.sh 0.0004 

sh ./scripts/tetest_comS1.sh 0.0004 
```

## üß© Train
- **Step**  Using INN to compensate the compression distortion of ELIC.
